    <string name="help">Outta My Circle features several rounds in which the goal is to defeat opponents by knocking them out from the arena. The last player standing wins the round. At the end of all the rounds, each player can win, lose or draw. When you select a skin, you can\'t play with other players with the same skin. You can also select an attack which can help you to defeat your opponents; after attacking, you have to wait a little bit before you can attack again. That\'s all. Ah, remember: Outta My Circle!</string>
